In my recorded breathing audio the breathing frequency is nearly 980Hz with the Roll-off(dB per octave) being 12.
Steps I have done:
1. Recoding the audio using mic and Audacity.
2. Selecting the audio and finding the sampling rate of the Audio to be 44100 Hz (for mostly recorded audio files) .
3. Using high pass filter I found the frequency to be nearly 800Hz where the breathing is most clear. And also visualised using spectrum analysis where the frequncy with highest peak below 1000 Hz.
